                                Hi! My name is Ana Arrontes and I am 21 years old. Currently I am studying for a Primary Education degree in English at the Autonomous university of Barcelona. As I am in my fourth year of the degree, I decided to enroll in the English minor, to become an English teacher. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have experience working with 2nd and 3rd graders, as I did my two internships with them, but I am currently working with 6th graders, so I have been able to work in the three school cycles. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a future teacher, I would like to teach them miningful contents and values using motivating and engaging methodologies. Such as Jigsaw, buzz groups, peer teaching and so on. Moreover, as I am studying how to implement CLIL in class, I would like to implement it someday, because it seems like a really funny and creative approach to teaching. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, I love working with technology and as it is really present nowadays, is a really useful tool to teach, as it is manipulative and creative to students. Technology can be used to teach easier new contents and as they can watch a video, picture, podcast, play video games, use AR or 360 imatges,etc.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Expectations</h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="about-text">
                            <p>
                                The Practicum is one of the most eagerly awaited and motivating parts for students, and in my case it is not an exception. I found the first Practicum very rewarding, enriching and useful for my development as a future teacher, and that is why I took many good memories of my first contact with the educational world and above all, I learned many things from the students and the tutor of the class, to which I was assigned, although it was a brief period of two weeks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On my second Practicum, I learned how to create and implement a didactic sequence on my own, as I was used to creating it with other classmates. As it was a longer period of time, I learned more about the students and had more confidence with them, so I could adapt better to their needs. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nevertheless, while implementing my first didactic sequence I came up with issues or situations that I did not know how to cope with or act. First of all, the level of some activities that I prepared for were higher and more difficult for the students than I expected, so I had to adapt to the situation and use more time than it was set. In other words I would like to learn how to better recognize the level of the activities that I create and the relation with the level of the class and how to manage time, what I should take into account when setting the time for each activity. In addition I would like to learn how to manage the classroom, because I do not really know what to do to get the attention of the students when they get dispersed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, for Practicum IV I expect to learn more methodologies, kinds of activities engaging and motivating for the students and how to adapt them to students with special needs. Moreover, I would like to learn strategies that help me to cope with common situations while students work in groups, such as students that are not doing their work or students that want to do all the activities by themselves. In my didactic sequence, I implemented the use of “càrrecs”, but it did not work properly in all the groups because of what I have already said, some students were doing all the “càrrecs” at the same time and did not allow other students to participate. And last but not least, I would like to learn how to act when something is not working or the activity is not adequate or students do not enjoy doing it, so they are not putting effort. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To conclude, as I will have to create and implement my second didactic sequence with another partner and we both already have experience, I hope that together we can create a better didactic sequence for our students. Together with the Practicum IV, I hope that we are able to not repeat the same errors again.

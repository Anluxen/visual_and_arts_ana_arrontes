						<h2>Artist Notebook</h2>
						<h3>Cover</h3>
						<p>For doing the notebook cover I used a sponge, I stamped the paint of different colours on the paper. I also sticked with withe glue some rope pieces and a piece of tree bark in order to make more 3D relief. I stuck some flowerish cloth to add texture to the notebook. For doing the artist notebook I decided to use a notebook shape because it is something that is practical, so I can bring it everywhere.</p>

					<div class="about-text">
						<h3>Second Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I decided to experiment with colour because I took a picture of some yellowish flowers that attracted my attention, so I used different filters that I liked the result of and that made the picture different and interesting.</p>

						<h3>Third Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">In my first walk, I took a picture of two trees that the shape that they made together reminded me of a harp. I wanted to print the picture and stick some yarn to represent the strings of the harp. </p>
					</div>

				<div class="col-lg-6 p-0">
					<div class="about-text">
						<h3>Fourth Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I sticked a picture of a fallen tree surrounded by nature and I got inspired by Bonnie Stahlecker’s notebook to do this kind of frame, cutting the cardboard, because she cutted in different shapes the pages to add 3D, so I did the same in my own way. </p>

						<h3>Fifth Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I used the technique of frottage to represent the relief of the tree in the picture of the previous page. I used the yellow colour because it was brighter and I could see the relief better. Moreover, I made a frame for this page cutting black cardboard and sticking it. I used black colour because the contrast of the colours was bigger.</p>

					<div class="about-text">
						<h3>Sixth Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3"> I wanted to add a surprise and I cutted the cardboard in order to make a kind of “window” or “structure” that can be opened, and I added under the cardboard a piece of cloth that I found at home that is a tree and reminded me on my walk. Moreover, I sticked some leaves that I found on my walking, in order to add more texture and personality to the notebook. </p>

						<h3>Seventh Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I included some pictures of the sky turning dark that I took during my first walk. </p>

					<div class="about-text">
						<h3>Eighth Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I included two pictures of the same place but the first one is from the first walking and the second one from the second walking. In the first picture I could observe that the day was bright and in the second one was cloudy, so that is a clear difference of changes of colours. In addition, in the second picture I could observe that there was snow on the mountain and some yellow flowers had grown. I decided to cut this page in two because I thought that it would look good and feel like an album in which it is not necessary to observe both pictures at the same time, to add more dynamism. </p>

						<h3>Ninth Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I included a picture of the tree bark because I liked the yellowish colour of the moss. I also cutted the cardboard with shapes inspiring in Bonnie Stahlecker’s  artist notebook as on the fourth page.</p>

					<div class="about-text">
						<h3>Tenth Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I represented the landscape that I saw glueing materials that I found on the walk, such as the grass or the plants, but for representing the clouds, I used cotton. I liked to represent the landscape with these materials because it adds 3D and texture. The cardboard was blue to represent the sky. For this page I got inspired by Cassandra Fernandez's notebook. Although I did not use paper and glue it on the cardboard, I used real materials and glued it on the cardboard. </p>

						<h3>Eleventh Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I did a fast and simple drawing to represent the narrow river that I saw in my walk, the green drawing is a bush that I saw to the side of the river. I got inspired by Louis Boyd, as she painted what she saw, but I did not do a big and difficult drawing because I do not know how to do it. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-6 p-0">
					<div class="about-text">
						<h3>Last Page</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I got inspired by Louis Boyd and Susan Bowers at the same time. I got inspired by Louis Boyd by the structure of the page, as the page that has a picture of the path that I followed with yellow flowers, can unfold and inside I sticked four rectangular and narrow pictures of the landscapes of the walk inspired by Susan Bowers. I got inspired by her because she drew some drawings in this narrow and rectangular format and unified them, but instead of unifying them I sticked them together. Moreover, as I am not good at drawing and I prefered to take videos and pictures during my walk, I changed from drawing to taking pictures of the two walkins that I did. To conclude, I unified all the pages together with brown rope.</p>

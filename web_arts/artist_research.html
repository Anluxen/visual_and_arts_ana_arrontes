						<h2>Artist Research</h2>
						<h3>Who is Antonio Canova?</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">Antonio Canova(1757-1822) is the principal figure of neoclassical sculpture. He got inspired by the anteek greece and was considered the best european sculptor since Bernini. Although he focused on neoclassical movement, he also was in contact with romanticism, being an influence and reference for sculptors of the XIX century.</p>
						<p>According to Miguel Calvo Santos (2016), at the age of 11 he began to study sculpture in Venice.  Bernini’s influence is soon perceived, but there is also an attempt to overcome the Baroque tradition.  His sculpture seeks the ideal of the beautiful through the ancient, gaining in serenity, which may seem coldness, but we can distinguish a certain emotion, and even a certain eroticism, the result of a refined sensuality.  It is a work that captures the movement, but effectively with a more “frozen” look than that of the Baroque masters.</p>
						<p>Some of his most relevant sculptures are Napoleon as Peacemaker Mars, Theseus and the Centaur and Eros and Psyche.</p>

						<h3>Why did I choose this artist?</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I chose this artist because my favourite sculpture is Eros and Psyche by Antonio Canova. I discovered this artwork when my teachers of high school explained to me the sculpture in greek and history of art subjects. The fact that I love the artist's works about ancient greek myths and also the tender history of Eros and Psyche, I was amazed by all the work of the artist for creating the sculpture and the treatment of the marble, the material used for sculpting.</p>
						<p>In addition, as in selectivitat I presented to history of art exam, Eros and Psyche was the artist work that I chose to analyze, and I got a high grade on the exam, thanks to that I entered this degree and Eros and Psyche is like a lucky charm for me.</p>

						<h3>Who is Louis Bourgeois?</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">The French sculptor used trauma, fears, anger... and her own secrets as tools for her work. Few artists have been as honest as she is about showing themselves, her work is autobiographical and shameless.</p>
						<p>According to Louis Bourgeois, making art has a healing effect, she understands art as therapy. Her biography is about a womanizing father who loved them all except herself. His father was a gallery owner who mocked modern art, this fact made Louis Bourgeois give up her mathematical career and create modern art, using her father’s infidelities as inspiration.</p>
						<p>According to Miguel Calvo (2016) her creative impulse seemed to be found in his childhood traumas and based his main themes on the rawness of emotions, translated into organic materials (wood, thread, paper...) and also recycled industrial materials (glass, rubber, bronze...).  She also used materials rejected by the ocean that she recycled to create art. As a sculptor she saw that she could magically transfer the immaterial into matter and following this alchemy she mixed her cocktail of human relationships, motherhood, sex, repression and pain. She exploited memory, sex, insecurity and the female body as tools and materials for her work that would evolve throughout the 20th century.</p>
						<p>Some of her most popular artworks are: Women-house, The destruction of the father, Fears, Legs and Mom.</p>

						<h3>Why did I choose this artist?</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I chose Louise Bourgeois because I discovered her in the history of art subject. I discovered her because her sculpture Mom appears in the list for the History of art exam in “selectivitat”. At first, I did not like her sculpture Mom because I have a fear of spiders, but after knowing that this sculpture represents her mother Isaw a different point of view although I continue having fear of spiders. Despite its terrifying appearance, a spider is thoughtful, intelligent, patient, delicate, subtle and helpful.</p>
						<p>According to Louise, there’s no better mother than a spider. It takes care of and protects its young (there we see the eggs in its belly), nourishes them.  A spider is strong and fragile at the same time, both tender mother and fearsome predator.</p>
						<p>I chose this artist because she is one of the few female artists that I know and I admire her for basing her artworks in traumas of her life, as her works make me feel more close to her and for feelings. Moreover, the fact that she used different kinds of materials, such as recycled materials, makes me think that art can be created with any kind of materials. and to use different kinds of materials, such as recycled materials to represent negative or positive feelings.</p>

						<h2>Exploring creativity</h2>
						<h3>Body-drawing</h3>
						<p>In the first session we did an activity in which we had to move freely through the class and paint with black waxes in big pieces of white paper distributed throughout the class, but we had to follow and listen to the music in order to draw. Also, there were pieces of paper on the floor, in order to try to paint like Heather Hansen or Tony Orrico. At first I was uncomfortable and ashamed, but later on, I started to feel more comfortable and to listen and draw what the music reminded me of but in a shapeless form, the beat, the melody, sounds, etc. I tried to draw on the floor, but I did not like it. I prefered to draw on the table. I felt that I could move more freely and faster.</p>
						<p>Later on, we had to move around the lines and shapes drawn with black waxes and search for shapes or  lines that reminded us of something and draw with coloured waxes, pencil colours or pens what it reminded us of. Firstly, I found some lines that reminded me of grass and I painted the grass and drew some flowers, but after that, I could appreciate that the grass also reminded me as an eyebrow and I painted it with another colour and drew an eye, and later another eye. Moreover I painted the hair with orange waxes and a nose. When I finished this drawing I drew a silver leaf in another part of the paper.</p>
						<p>In conclusion, I appreciated and enjoyed this activity, because I felt that I could draw whatever I wanted, so I could explore creativity. Moreover, I liked watching what the other people drew and why, so I was able to understand what they were thinking on to create it. Furthermore, I consider that doing this activity in class with primary students can be beneficial for developing their artistic competence as they work body, movement, line, stroke, drawing colour, imagination and creativity among others. I definitely would try this activity with my Primary students.</p>

						<h3>Colour perception</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">In the second session we learned how to create and experiment with different colours starting from the primary colours. Later on, as we had to bring some pictures taken from the sky and a cardboard box, I chose a picture of the sky and tried to paint it, creating the colours by mixing them in order to find the colours of the sky. Nevertheless, as it was the second or third time that I painted with paint, I do not know how to paint and I did not got the results expected and for me, the sky of the picture was not represented in the drawing, I could not find the colours needed by mixing, I got an approximation.</p>
						<p>I liked the fact that the class was based on the idea of Francesc Ruiz Abad, as the cardboard box was a recycled material and the frame of the cardboard box works as a frame for the painting, I thought that it was original and that the frame can be painted or decorated with other kinds of materials. It is also accessible for all the students in a school, because it is a recycled material. Moreover, bringing a picture of the sky is significant and also accessible for all the students as they will paint something that they have taken a picture or that they like. They also work on how to create colours and to observe colours. I consider that is also a good activity to work in class, but before we should work on how to paint with brushes and paintings or some tips to do it.</p>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>Firstly, I enjoyed doing the activities and preparing the website as a portfolio for all the activities, pictures, artworks and drawings that I made during the course, although it was a lot of hard work.</p>
						<p>Furthermore, I consider that although it is a short subject, I have learned a lot of artists and activities that I can do with my primary students when I become a teacher, for instance drawing using body movement, colouring perception, the walk and the artist notebook and the exhibitions and artists research.</p>
						<p>Moreover, I believe that it is really useful that we were able to create our didactic unit inspired in one workshop that offers a museum. I was able to see the museums with other eyes because I  never did an art workshop in a museum when I was in primary or secondary school.</p>
						<p>In addition, we had to reflect on the workshop and what we want them to learn and think in a transdisciplinary way, to work on the same topic but in different points of view and activities. When we went to see the exposition of Juli Gonzalez, we had to focus on his artwork and how to work with students, his ideas and representations and to put on the role of a teacher in a real context.</p>
						<p>To conclude, I would recommend this subject to other students because it is really helpful to prepare ourselves for being art teachers and how to approach the activities or ideas. Nevertheless, I consider that it would be interesting to include more digital art activities, for instance an art video, digital painting or how to work taking good pictures with students, as technology surrounds us nowadays. I am aware that technology art needs a lot of resources to be developed, but maybe they can do research on digital artists. Also, how to motivate students that do not like art subjects because they do not feel that they are good at it.</p>

						<h2>Documentary</h2>
						<h3>Who is Andy Goldsworthy?</h3>
						<p>Sculptor (and photographer) of Land Art, Andy Goldsworthy creates his sculptural work in specific places and uses natural tools and materials, resulting in ephemeral works.  That is why photography, which documents the process of creation, is of utmost importance in his art.</p>
						<p>Goldsworthy uses flowers, leaves, ice, mud, snow, stones, branches, thorns... And manipulates them only with his hands (sometimes with his teeth as well, as I could observe in the documentary in Rivers and tides).  He is famous for his balancing stones that are held as if by magic.</p>
						<p>According to Miguel Calvo Santos, Andy Goldsworthy uses natural geometry, the balance of nature.  Balance also means that nothing is eternal, that everything has its beginning and end, except perhaps nature itself, with its patterns, its infinite births and deaths, its circles and spirals.  Art for Goldsworthy is perhaps a way of understanding it, of exploring it, of mastering it, even if only for the moments that the work lasts.  But Goldsworthy doesn’t look for paradise on earth, he doesn’t look like a mystic.  His work seems to seek to understand gravity, biology, materials…Goldsworthy is able to observe the effects of time in nature.</p>
						<p>Some of his most relevant artworks are: Storm King Wall, Touching North, Screen and Mountain to Cost.</p>

						<h3>Reflection</h3>
						<p class="mt-md-3">I enjoyed watching the documentary Rivers and tides by Andy Goldsworthy because it was satisfying and amazing to observe him create his sculptures. I am amazed by his patience, because the structures are fragile and can collapse easily. It is hard work and is deceiving when the structure falls down.</p>
						<p>Moreover, the materials are very important and it is difficult to work with them as sometimes he uses fragile materials, for instance ice or snow, that melts and especially ice is hard to manipulate. Although the sculpture falling down is part of the process, for me it would be hard to accept that my artwork, that I invested a lot of time in, would fall down at any time.</p>
						<p>I liked the sculpture of the monoliths egg-shaped, because they are in all the places that he had liked the most and are really difficult to create. Furthermore, I appreciate the creativity that he has, because he uses the colours of the natural elements and gets inspired by them. He sometimes works in extreme conditions without gloves because he has to feel the materials perfectly.</p>
						<p>In addition, I regret not having watched this documentary before my walking, as I was stressed by all the work of the other subjects, because maybe I would have tried to do my own sculpture using natural elements, although it is really difficult to think about a sculpture.</p>
						<p>To conclude, I consider that working this artist with primary students would be interesting and motivating for them, because it is innovative and they only need natural materials. They can do sculptures individually or collaboratively, with the help of other students.</p>

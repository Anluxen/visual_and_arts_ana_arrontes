                            <p>
                                After implementing the teaching unit I have to admit that some aspects of the implementation have been very stressful as my co teaching partner and I had to create a huge amount of materials as we had to create ten different boxes with materials, instructions,etc. Also it was desmotivating because a lot of activities did not work well in class or for some groups yes but other ones not. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although this part of the teaching unit implementation was hard to assimilate it has also enriching for as because as we had to implement the same sessions to both groups when something did not work well we as partners talked together about the things that went well and the ones that did not work well so we adapted a lot of activities, we made them shorter or add extra materials as a support because we could observe that the activities were complex. It is true that we were in a hurry because we had to adapt two sessions for the next day to implement it in the group.                             </p>
                            <p>
                                As a future teacher, I would like to teach them miningful contents and values using motivating and engaging methodologies. Such as Jigsaw, buzz groups, peer teaching and so on. Moreover, as I am studying how to implement CLIL in class, I would like to implement it someday, because it seems like a really funny and creative approach to teaching. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, we had to be very flexible as we had to manage complex Covid-19 situations, for example we had some students confined at home and for some activities we took a Chromebook and made a video call with them so they could work in the boxes with their group mates as usually but for other activities we had to post them in the Google classroom so that they could work on the activities alone at home. It was a really difficult situation to manage because the students that were connected from home were constantly lost, but as we were two teachers together it was easier to manage the situation, as we could share the responsibilities. Another concrete situation that happened in my group is that they were all confined the same week that they had the final product that was to create the final timeline in groups. I decided to include a tool that we used with Dr. Dooly and Dr. Sadler in class, it is called Gather town and it consists on having an space in which you can walk around and talk with people that is next to you, but is perfect to work in groups as there are private spaces in which you can enter and you only talk and listen those who are inside the same space.Students loved the platform and had a lot of fun, they were all the time telling me that it was really cool and that they wanted to use it again. I will share the link to the space of Gather Town that I used below. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, I consider that this teaching unit was more difficult to create that the one that I created last year because we did not have a lot of time to meet with school teachers, we had to create it alone at home, as in Practicum II we were in our intensiv period I could ask to my school tutor doubts every day. As we did not have as much help as last year I consider that we learned more, because when we showed the teaching unit to our school teachers they loved it and made some comments on how to improve some things or to be aware of possible situations, they also told us to adapt the sequence in case of Covid-19 confinement and it was easier to manage the situations that happened on the future.
